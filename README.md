# Rhys' Development Environment

## What even is this?

This contains all my dotfiles and other related configuration files to set up what I'm using currently in my local development environment.

This is constantly growing, so if for some reason you decide to use it, please keep checking back to see if something changed.

## Setup

Just clone this into your home directory and source your files - you should be good to go from there.

These files cover:
- Setting up Wezterm the way I enjoy using it
- Setting up tmux to be a bit more ergonomic

Eventually I'll probably write a script or something to set up config for programs that don't look for this in the home directory, or for things like homebrew.
